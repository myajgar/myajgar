Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Ans :data structure is need to arrange and process the data in the memory for efficient storage,access,processing.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
searching ,inserting,deleting ,sorting,merging,
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
what is an Array?
array are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
array size fixed arraylist resizeable.
what is LinkedList?
a linkedList is a collection of object known as node where node consists of two parts,data and address.
How is an Array different from Linked List?
data types is the operation you can perform on them.
what is queue?
java queue is a data structure that use the FIFO rules.in this rule , the element added first,remove first as well.
what is stack?
the stack is a liner data structure that  uses the LIFO rule which the data added last will be removed first .
what is FIFO and LIFO?
LIFO-last -in -first -out
FIFO-first-in-first-out
what is the order of complexity?
measures the time taken for running algorithm and it is commonly used to count the number of elementary operation
performs by the algorithm to improve the performance.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
the best case of the unsorted array is O(n).
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
the worst case is also O(n).
what is tree in data structure?
what is graph in data structure?
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a subclass of IndexOutOfBoundsException,and it implements the serializable
interface.the occurs happen when we trying to access any item which is not present in the array.
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
a.using variable assignment
b.create a new array of the same length and copy each element.
c.use the clone method of the array.
d.use system.
What is DFS and BFS?
DFS-depth first search
BFS-breadth first search
What is Recursion?
recursion is the technique of making a function call itself.
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
linear-element are store sequentially and the element are connected to the previous and the next element.
non-linear-
What is Big-(O)-notation?
big o notation is used computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
